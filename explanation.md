Based on the provided code, the red X that is used with the move action has the following functionality:

**1. Visual Target Indicator:**
The red X is a visual crosshair that appears on the main `BotCanvas` (the world view). Its primary purpose is to show the user the exact destination coordinates for a `move_to` command *before* it is sent to a bot.

**2. Activation:**
It appears only when the following two conditions are met:
*   The **"Move"** command is selected in the `NewCommandCenter`. This sets the application's `selected
Command` state to `'move_to'`.
*   A target destination has been set. This populates the `moveTarget` state with `{x, y, z}` coordinates.

**3. Setting the Target (How the X is placed):**
The position of the red X can be set in two ways:
*   **By Clicking on the Canvas:** When the "Move" command is active, left-clicking anywhere on the `BotCanvas` will place the red X at that location. The click coordinates are translated into in-game world coordinates and stored as the `moveTarget`.
*   **By Manual Coordinate Entry:** The "Move Options" panel in the `NewCommandCenter` has input fields for X, Y, and Z coordinates. As the user types new values into these fields, the position of the red X on the `BotCanvas` updates in real-time to reflect the entered coordinates.

**4. Functionality within the UI Flow:**
The red X serves as a crucial piece of user feedback in the command workflow:
1.  The user selects a bot.
2.  The user clicks the "Move" button in the `NewCommandCenter`.
3.  The user clicks a destination on the `BotCanvas` or types coordinates.
4.  The **red X appears**, confirming the chosen target location. The user can adjust this by clicking again or editing the coordinates.
5.  Once satisfied with the X's position, the user clicks the "Execute Move" button to send the command with the target coordinates to the selected bot.

In summary, the red X is a **dynamic, client-side visual aid** that represents the destination for a move command. It provides clear visual feedback and allows the user to precisely set a target location either graphically (by clicking) or numerically (by typing) before committing to the action.

**Relevant Code Snippets:**

*   **`BotCanvas.tsx` (lines 313-332):** This `useEffect` block contains the logic to draw the red crosshair (`strokeStyle = '#ff0000'`) whenever `selectedCommand` isBased on the provided code, the red X is a visual target indicator used specifically with the `move_to` command. Its functionality can be broken down as follows:

### 1. Visual Purpose
The red X, rendered as a crosshair on the `BotCanvas`, shows the user the exact destination coordinates for a move command before it is sent to a bot.

 `'move_to'` and `moveTarget` is not null.
*   **`App.tsx` (lines 3### 2. Activation
- The red X only appears on the `BotCanvas` when the **"Move" action04-309):** The `handleCanvasClick` function sets the `moveTarget` state when the** is selected in the `NewCommandCenter`.
- The rendering logic is in `BotCanvas.tsx` and is conditional:
  ```typescript
  // Draw move target crosshair
  if (selectedCommand === 'move_to' && canvas is clicked while the move command is active.
*   **`NewCommandCenter.tsx` (lines 16 moveTarget) {
    // ... code to draw the red crosshair
  }
  ```

### 3.0-167 & 590-621):** This component synchronizes its coordinate input fields with the `moveTarget` state, allowing manual input to update the X's position. It also contains the "Move" Placement and Interaction
There are two ways to set the position of the red X:

*   **Clicking on the Canvas:** button that activates this functionality.
    - When the "Move" action is selected, the `BotCanvas` cursor changes to a crosshair.
    - Left-clicking anywhere on the canvas calls the `handleCanvasClick` function in `App.tsx`.
    - This function translates the on-screen click position into in-game coordinates and updates the `moveTarget` state.
    - The red X is then drawn at this new `moveTarget` location.

*   **Manual Coordinate Input:**
    - The `NewCommandCenter` displays input fields for X, Y, and Z coordinates when the "Move" action is selected.
    - The user can manually type values into these fields.
    - As the user types, the `moveTarget` state is updated, which causes the red X on the `BotCanvas` to move to the newly specified coordinates in real

Of course. Rewriting this as a modern React application involves breaking down the UI and logic into discrete, reusable components and managing state in a clear, predictable way.

Here is a breakdown of the philosophy, file structure, and component structure I would use.

### Overall Philosophy

1.  **Separation of Concerns:** The core logic will be separated into three main areas:
    *   **State Management & Data Fetching:** A custom hook (`useVoxelStream`) will handle the WebSocket connection, data processing, and all related state (voxel list, stats, connection status). This isolates side effects from the UI.
    *   **3D Rendering:** A dedicated component (`VoxelCanvas`) will manage the entire Three.js world. It will be a "dumb" component that simply receives data and renders it, without knowing where the data comes from.
    *   **UI Components:** The various panels, buttons, and displays will be broken into small, presentational components that receive data and callbacks as props.

2.  **Unidirectional Data Flow:** The main `App` component will be the "source of truth." It will use the `useVoxelStream` hook to get the state and then pass that state down to the `VoxelCanvas` and UI components as props. Actions (like clicking "Clear") will be handled by callback functions passed down from `App`.

3.  **Component Reusability:** Create generic components where possible. For example, the two UI panels share common styling. We can create a generic `Panel` component that `StatusPanel` and `ControlsPanel` can both use.

### Proposed File Structure

A standard `create-react-app` or Vite project structure would be a good starting point. I'd organize the components logically.

```
/src
├── App.js                # Main component, orchestrates everything
├── App.css               # Global styles (body, fonts, etc.)

├── components/
│   ├── VoxelCanvas/
│   │   ├── index.js      # The Three.js canvas component
│   │   └── three-manager.js # (Optional) A helper class to encapsulate Three.js logic
│   │
│   ├── UI/               # Directory for all UI-related components

```

### Component Breakdown (No Code)

#### 1. `hooks/useVoxelStream.js` (Custom Hook)

*   **Responsibility:** This is the brain of the application. It is not a component, but a reusable function that encapsulates all the business logic.
*   **Internal Logic:**
    *   Manages the WebSocket connection (`new WebSocket(...)`), including connection, message, close, and error handlers.
    *   Holds the core application state: the list/map of voxels, the connection status (`'connected'`, `'connecting'`, `'disconnected'`), the `isPaused` flag, and all calculated stats (voxel count, rate, bounds, etc.).
    *   Parses incoming WebSocket messages and updates the state accordingly.
    *   Exposes functions to the outside world to `clearAllVoxels`, `togglePause`, etc.
*   **Returns:** An object containing the current state and the functions to modify it. e.g., `{ stats, voxels, isPaused, connectionStatus, clear, togglePause }`.

#### 2. `App.js` (The Orchestrator)

*   **Responsibility:** The top-level component that ties everything together.
*   **Internal Logic:**
    *   Calls the `useVoxelStream` hook to get all the data and action functions.
    *   Renders the main layout, including the `VoxelCanvas` and the UI panels.
    *   Passes the necessary state down to child components as props. For example, it passes `stats` to `StatusPanel` and the `voxels` data to `VoxelCanvas`.
    *   Passes the action functions (like `clear` and `togglePause`) down to the `ActionButtons` component as callbacks.

#### 3. `components/VoxelCanvas/index.js`

*   **Responsibility:** Manages and renders the Three.js scene.
*   **Props:**
    *   `voxels`: The current set of voxel data to render.
    *   `centerRequest`: A trigger prop (e.g., a counter) that tells the component to run its `centerCamera` logic.
    *   `onVoxelDoubleClick`: A callback function to notify the parent of an interaction.
*   **Internal Logic:**
    *   Uses a `useRef` to get a handle on the `canvas` DOM element.
    *   Uses `useEffect` to initialize the Three.js scene, camera, renderer, and controls on first render. This `useEffect` must also return a cleanup function to dispose of Three.js objects when the component unmounts.
    *   Uses another `useEffect` that listens for changes to the `voxels` prop. When the prop changes, it updates the Three.js scene by adding, removing, or modifying voxel meshes.
    *   Contains all the Three.js-specific code: creating geometries, materials, lights, and handling the render loop with `requestAnimationFrame`.

#### 4. `components/UI/Panel.js` (Reusable Wrapper)

*   **Responsibility:** Provides the common container styling for all UI panels (the semi-transparent background, border, padding, etc.).
*   **Props:**
    *   `children`: The content to be rendered inside the panel.
    *   `title`: A string for the panel's header.
    *   `isMinimizable`: Boolean to show/hide the minimize button.
    *   Any other props needed to control its position (`top`, `left`, `bottom`, `right`).
*   **Internal State:**
    *   Manages its own `isMinimized` state if it's minimizable.

#### 5. `components/UI/StatusPanel/index.js`

*   **Responsibility:** Displays all the dynamic statistics and the color legend.
*   **Props:**
    *   `stats`: An object containing all the data to display (`{ voxelCount, rate, uniqueCount, bounds, connectionStatus }`).
    *   `onClear`, `onPause`, `onCenter`: Callback functions passed down from `App.js`.
    *   `isPaused`: Boolean to determine the text on the pause/resume button.
*   **Internal Logic:**
    *   Uses the reusable `Panel` component as its wrapper.
    *   Renders the various child components like `StatItem`, `ColorLegend`, and `ActionButtons`, passing the relevant props to them.

#### 6. `components/UI/StatusPanel/StatItem.js`

*   **Responsibility:** Renders a single "Label: Value" line item.
*   **Props:**
    *   `label`: The string for the label (e.g., "Rate:").
    *   `value`: The value to display (e.g., "1,234 voxels/s").

#### 7. `components/UI/StatusPanel/ColorLegend.js`

*   **Responsibility:** Renders the static list of voxel types and their corresponding colors.
*   **Props:** None. The data is static and can be defined directly within this component as a constant array, which is then mapped to JSX elements.

#### 8. `components/ActionButtons/index.js`

*   **Responsibility:** Renders the group of main action buttons.
*   **Props:**
    *   `isPaused`: Boolean to control the "Pause/Resume" button's text.
    *   `onClear`: Callback for the Clear button.
    *   `onPause`: Callback for the Pause button.
    *   `onCenter`: Callback for the Center button.
*   **Internal Logic:** Each button has an `onClick` handler that calls the corresponding function from its props.

#### 9. `components/UI/ControlsPanel/index.js`

*   **Responsibility:** Displays the static help text for mouse controls and axis colors.
*   **Props:** None. This is a purely presentational, static component.
*   **Internal Logic:** Uses the reusable `Panel` component as its wrapper and contains hardcoded text content.
